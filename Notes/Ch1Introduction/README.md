# Introduction
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers and machines to imitate the way that humans learn, to perform tasks autonomously, and to improve their performance and accuracy through experience and exposure to more data.
## Relationship between AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning
### AI
- Any technique that enables computers to mimic human intelligence, using logic, if-then rule, decision tree, and machine learning(including deep learning).
### Machine Learning
- A subset of AI that includes abstruse statistical techniques that enable machine to improve at tasks with experience. The category includes deep learning.
### Deep Learning
- The subset of machine learning composed of algorithms that permit software to train itself to perform tasks, like speech and image recoginition, by exposing multilayered neural network to vast amounts of data.

Machine Learning is a technique to implement AI that can learn from the data by themselves without being explicitly programmed.

**Types of Machine Learning**
ML systems falls into one or more of the following categories based on how they learn to make predictions or generate content:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Generative AI

## Supervised Learning
This models can make prediction afterseeing lots of data with the correct answering and then discovering the connection between the elements in the data that produce the both questions and answers. These ML systems are "supervised" in the sense that a human gives the ML system data with the known correct results.
**Two most common use case for supervised learning are:**
- Regression 
- Classification

### Regression
A regression model predicts a numeric value. For example, a weather model that predicts the amount of rain, in inches or millimeters, is a regression model.

See the table below for more examples of regression models:

| **Scenario**         | **Possible Input Data**                                                                                                                                      | **Numeric Prediction**                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Future house price   | Square footage, zip code, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, mortgage interest rate, property tax rate, construction costs, number of homes for sale | The price of the home                         |
| Future ride time     | Historical traffic conditions (from smartphones, traffic sensors, ride-hailing apps), distance to destination, and weather conditions                        | Time in minutes and seconds to destination    |

### Classification
Classification models predict the likelihood that something belongs to a category.  
Unlike regression models, whose output is a number, classification models output a value that states whether or not something belongs to a particular category.

For example, classification models are used to:
- Predict if an email is spam
- Detect if a photo contains a cat

#### Types of Classification Models

Classification models are divided into two groups:

##### 1. Binary Classification
- Outputs a value from a class that contains **only two values**
- Example: A model that predicts **rain** or **no rain**

##### 2. Multiclass Classification
- Outputs a value from a class that contains **more than two values**
- Example: A model that predicts **rain**, **hail**, **snow**, or **sleet**
