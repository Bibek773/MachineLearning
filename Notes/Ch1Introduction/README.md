# Introduction
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers and machines to imitate the way that humans learn, to perform tasks autonomously, and to improve their performance and accuracy through experience and exposure to more data.
## Relationship between AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning
### AI
- Any technique that enables computers to mimic human intelligence, using logic, if-then rule, decision tree, and machine learning(including deep learning).
### Machine Learning
- A subset of AI that includes abstruse statistical techniques that enable machine to improve at tasks with experience. The category includes deep learning.
### Deep Learning
- The subset of machine learning composed of algorithms that permit software to train itself to perform tasks, like speech and image recoginition, by exposing multilayered neural network to vast amounts of data.

Machine Learning is a technique to implement AI that can learn from the data by themselves without being explicitly programmed.

**Types of Machine Learning**
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
